Golang Mastery Roadmap - One Month Plan

📌 Overview

This structured roadmap will help you master Golang in one month by covering fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and hands-on projects. The focus is on writing idiomatic Go code, building scalable applications, and optimizing performance.

🗓️ Roadmap Breakdown

Week 1: Core Golang Fundamentals

Topics Covered

-Golang Environment Setup & Tooling

-Basics: Variables, Data Types, Constants

-Control Flow: Loops, Conditionals, Switch

-Functions, Methods & Closures

-Arrays, Slices, and Maps

-Structs & Interfaces

-Pointers & Memory Management

Hands-on Tasks

>>Swap two numbers using pointers.

>>Remove duplicates from a slice.

>>Implement a "BankAccount" struct with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

>>Explain Go's memory allocation for slices.

Week 2: Concurrency & Parallelism

Topics Covered

Goroutines & Channels (Buffered/Unbuffered)

Select Statement & Multiplexing Channels

Sync Mechanisms: Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroups

Context Package for Goroutine Management

Worker Pools & Fan-out/Fan-in Patterns

Performance Optimization with Parallelism

Hands-on Tasks

Compute squares of numbers using multiple goroutines.

Implement a worker pool with Goroutines and Channels.

Use context.WithTimeout() in an HTTP server.

Demonstrate a deadlock and fix it.

Week 3: Web Development & APIs

Topics Covered

REST API Development with Gin

Middleware (Authentication, Logging, Rate Limiting)

Database Integration (PostgreSQL, MySQL, GORM)

Dependency Injection & Clean Architecture

Unit Testing APIs with httptest

Hands-on Tasks

Build a CRUD-based Task Manager API.

Implement JWT-based authentication middleware in Gin.

Write a Gin middleware to log request details.

Mock database queries in unit tests using sqlmock.

Week 4: Advanced Topics & System Design

Topics Covered

Garbage Collection & Memory Optimization

Writing Highly Performant Go Code (Profiling & Benchmarking)

Secure Coding Practices (Avoiding Race Conditions, SQL Injection)

Microservices Architecture in Go

Caching Strategies (Redis, BadgerDB)

CI/CD Pipelines & Dockerizing Go Apps

Hands-on Tasks

Profile and optimize a Go function using pprof.

Implement Redis-based caching for an API.

Deploy a Go application in Docker and optimize container size.

Build a rate-limiting middleware using Golang channels.

🎯 Final Project

At the end of the month, build a "Real-Time Chat Application" using:

Gin for the backend

WebSockets for real-time messaging

PostgreSQL for message storage

Redis for caching

🚀 Key Strategies for Success

✅ Write Code Daily – Build real projects to solidify knowledge.
✅ Debug & Optimize – Read Go source code to understand internals.
✅ Follow Best Practices – Stick to idiomatic Go.
✅ Think About System Design – Focus on scalability and concurrency.
✅ Ask Why? – Don't just memorize; understand why Go works the way it does.
✅ Contribute to Open Source – Engage in Golang projects on GitHub.
